    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces server load.\n",
    "- ✅ Faster page load times.\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces network traffic.\n",

    "\n",
    "Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching is a **distributed network of servers** placed in various locations worldwide. Its main purpose is to serve content to end-users **with high availability and performance** by caching frequently accessed content on nearby servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. A user requests content from a website using a CDN.\n",
    "2. The CDN checks if the requested content is available in a nearby server's cache.\n",
    "3. If found, the cached content is served from the nearby server.\n",
    "4. If not found, the content is retrieved from the origin server, then cached for future requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces the distance data needs to travel.\n",
    "- ✅ Decreases the load on the origin server.\n",
    "- ✅ Enables faster content delivery.\n"
