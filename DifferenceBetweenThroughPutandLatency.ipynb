    "### **Difference Between Latency and Throughput**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency** refers to the amount of time taken by a system to respond to a request. It is generally measured in **milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (Âµs)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency depends on various factors:**  \n",
    "1. Network conditions  \n",
    "2. Network congestion  \n",
    "3. Inefficient algorithms  \n",
    "4. Load on system resources  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Throughput** refers to the number of requests a system can handle **simultaneously**. It is generally measured in **requests per second (RPS), transactions per second (TPS), or bits per second (bps)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Throughput depends on various factors:**  \n",
    "1. Available bandwidth  \n",
    "2. CPU capacity  \n",
    "3. Memory capacity  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tradeoff Between Latency and Throughput**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. One way to increase **throughput** is by **adding more servers** to the system. However, this can **increase latency**, as requests need to be routed to different servers and data must be replicated across them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another way to improve **throughput** is by **optimizing server software** to handle more requests simultaneously. However, this can also **increase latency**, as the server may need to allocate additional resources to keep up with the increased demand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, there is a **tradeoff between latency and throughput**. We must find the right balance between **low latency** and **high throughput** to optimize system performance.  \n"
