    "### **DNS (Domain Name System)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Web browsers interact with the server through an Internet Protocol (IP) address. It is not practical to remember the IP addresses of all the websites that we use in daily life. **DNS solves this problem** by providing a **rememberable name corresponding to each IP address** of the server. This is called the **Domain Name** of that web server. Now, with the help of the domain name, humans can access information online through domain names like **example.com** instead of remembering complex IP addresses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Domain Name System (DNS) translates the Domain Name to an IP Address**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "`www.google.com` â†’ `191.111.230.001`  \n",

    "### **How DNS Works**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Till now, we know that the work of the **DNS is translating the Domain Name to the IP Address**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![DNS Process](<attachment:Frame_1 (1).gif>)  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are **4 DNS servers** involved in loading a webpage:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DNS Recursor:**  \n",
    "   After receiving a **DNS query** from a web client, a recursive resolver will either respond with **cached data** or send a request to a **root nameserver**, followed by another request to a **TLD nameserver**, and then one last request to an **authoritative nameserver**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   After receiving a response from the authoritative nameserver containing the requested **IP address**, the **recursive resolver** then sends a response to the client.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   During this process, the **recursive resolver caches** the information provided by the authoritative nameservers. When a client requests the IP address of a domain name that was recently requested by another client, the **DNS resolver uses the cached data**, skipping the previous steps and **delivering the requested record from its cache**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root Nameserver:**  \n",
    "   There are **13 DNS root nameservers** that are known to every **DNS resolver** and are **pre-configured**. These servers allow it to initiate a **DNS lookup** by contacting one of the **root servers** to start the process of **finding the IP address for a given Domain Name**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The **root nameserver responds** by directing the **recursive resolver** to a **TLD nameserver**, based on the domain extension (**.com, .net, .org, etc.**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The **root nameservers** are overseen by a nonprofit organization called the **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TLD (Top-Level Domain) Nameserver:**  \n",
    "   TLD nameservers maintain the information for all **domain names** that share a common domain extension, such as **.com, .net, .org, .in, etc.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, the **.org TLD nameserver** contains the information for **every website that ends in .org**. If a user searches for **google.com**, after receiving a response from a **root nameserver**, the **recursive resolver** will then send a query to a **.com TLD nameserver**, which will respond by pointing to the **authoritative nameserver** for that domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The management of **TLD nameservers** is handled by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**, which is a branch of **ICANN**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The **IANA breaks up the TLD servers into two main groups:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs):**  \n",
    "      These domains are **not country-specific**. Some of the best-known generic TLDs include **.com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov**.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. **Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs):**  \n",
    "      These domains are specific to a **country or state**. Examples include **.us (United States), .in (India), and .jp (Japan)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Authoritative Nameserver:**  \n",
    "   When a **recursive resolver** receives a response from a **TLD nameserver**, that response will direct the resolver to an **authoritative nameserver**. The **authoritative nameserver** is usually the **final step** in the journey to obtaining an IP address.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The **authoritative nameserver** contains information **specific to the domain name it serves** (e.g., `abc.com`) and provides the **recursive resolver with the IP address** of that server.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Cloud-based managed DNS providers:**  \n",
    "   - **Cloudflare DNS**  \n",
    "   - **AWS Route 53**  \n",
    "   - **Google Cloud DNS**  \n"
