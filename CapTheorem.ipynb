    "### **2. Eventual Consistency**  \n",
    "After a write, a read **will eventually** reflect the latest data (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated **asynchronously**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is used in **highly available systems**.  \n",

    "#### **Active-Passive**  \n",
    "With active-passive failover, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in **hot standby** or whether it needs to start up from **cold standby**. Only the active server handles traffic.  \n",

    "#### **Active-Active**  \n",
    "In active-active failover, both servers are managing traffic by spreading the load **between** them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the servers are public-facing, the **DNS** would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.  \n",
